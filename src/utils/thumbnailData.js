  title: "Nobody - Official Trailer (HD)",
  description: "In Theaters Only March 26\nhttps://www.nobody.movie\n\nSometimes the man you don’t notice is the most dangerous of all. \n\nEmmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life’s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  \nWhen two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away.\n \nThe aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch’s long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon’s McMafia)—and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.\n\nNobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch’s father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch’s brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  \n\nThe film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a. (Hell or High Water, Wind River), for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu’s PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, Annie Marter and Tobey Maguire.",

  description: "Watch the trailer for The Little Things, bringing Denzel Washington back to screen alongside fellow Academy Award® winners Rami Malek and Jared Leto. In theaters now. #TheLittleThingsMovie\n\n\nAcademy Award winners Denzel Washington (“Training Day,” “Glory”), Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) and Jared Leto (“Dallas Buyers Club”) star in the psychological thriller “The Little Things.” John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side,” “Saving Mr. Banks,” “The Founder”) directed the film from his own original screenplay.\n\nKern County Deputy Sheriff Joe “Deke” Deacon (Washington) is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke’s cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke’s past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case.\n\nThe main cast also includes Natalie Morales (“Battle of the Sexes”), Terry Kinney (“Mile 22,” TV’s “Billions”), Chris Bauer (“Sully,” TV’s “The Deuce”), Joris Jarsky (TV’s “Bad Blood”), Isabel Arraiza (TV’s “Pearson”) and Michael Hyatt (“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”).\n\n“The Little Things” is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (“Breaking Bad,” “Rain Man”) and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers.\n\nBehind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (“Seabiscuit,” “The Founder,” “Saving Mr. Banks”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“Apollo 13,” “The Founder,” “The Blind Side”) editor Robert Frazen (“The Founder”), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (“The Founder,” “The Blind Side”). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (“1917,” “Bridge of Spies,” “Saving Mr. Banks”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents A Gran Via Production, “The Little Things” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film has slated for release on January 29, 2021 in theaters and on HBO Max and has been rated R for violent/disturbing images, language and full nudity.",

Lee and an innovative filmmaking team including Ryan Coogler and Maverick Carter.  This transformational journey is a manic mashup of two worlds that reveals just how far some parents will go to connect with their kids. When LeBron and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.’s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you’ve never seen them before.  It’s Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron’s bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself. The ready-for-action Tunes destroy convention, supercharge their unique talents and surprise even “King” James by playing the game their own way.\n\nJames stars alongside Oscar nominee Don Cheadle (the “Avengers” films, “Hotel Rwanda”), Khris Davis (“Judas and the Black Messiah,” TV’s “Atlanta”), Sonequa Martin-Green (TV’s “The Walking Dead,” “Star Trek: Discovery”), newcomer Cedric Joe, Jeff Bergman (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”), Eric Bauza (“Looney Tunes Cartoons”), and Zendaya (upcoming “Dune,” “Malcolm & Marie”).\n\nLee (“Girls Trip,” “Night School”) directs from a screenplay by Juel Taylor & Tony Rettenmaier & Keenan Coogler & Terence Nance.
